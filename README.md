## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

#### 1. Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### 2. Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
cd server
npm install
cd ..
```

#### 3. Set Up Supabase Database

1. Create a free account at https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Create a new project
3. Get your Project URL and anon key from Settings > API
4. Create database tables (see `SETUP.md` for SQL scripts)

#### 4. Configure Environment

Create `server/.env`:
```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
PORT=3001

# Optional: For real AI audio analysis (get free key at https://www.assemblyai.com)
ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=your_assemblyai_api_key_here

# Topic modeling (taxonomy-based – optional, free tier):
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here      # Get free at console.groq.com/keys

# Optional: For OpenAI-powered "Find Your Style" chat (paid)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Create `.env` in root directory (for frontend):
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

> **Note**: 
> - Without an AssemblyAI API key, the app uses simulated analysis data. The free tier includes 100 hours of audio analysis.
> - **Topic modeling** uses a fixed comedy taxonomy and Groq (Llama) to classify jokes into topics. Get a free key at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com/keys). Without it, keyword-based topic extraction is used.
> - Without an OpenAI API key, "Find Your Style" uses keyword-based style detection. Adding the key enables AI-powered zero-shot classification.

#### 5. Start the Backend Server

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:3001`

#### 6. Start the Frontend Development Server

In a new terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### 7. Open Your Browser

Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Database

- The backend uses **Supabase** (PostgreSQL) for cloud storage
- Data persists across app restarts and devices
- Free tier includes 500MB database and 2GB bandwidth
- See `SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
